Platformer: Working Title (MAY 17 2013)

This is a current work in progress of a platformer game I've been working on. Since I've basically made a rectangle jump across the screen, I figured I'd put it under version control. 

This isn't meant to be a serious project, but instead a way for me to get a grasp on basic game programming design, and hopefully some simple enemy AI down the road. 

This isn't my primary project, and it will get updated when I get the itch to work on it some more.

Lastly, I plan to draw all sprites from hand, no matter how laughably pathetic they will be. This is serious business.
